# TEXT-EXTRACTION-FROM-IMAGES-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK

Today, most of the information is available either on paper or in the form of

images containing typed, printed, painted or scene text into machine encoded text. Obtaining
such textual information from images is important as it facilitates many different
applications, e.g. search and recommendation of images
